This SQL query calculates the average amount spent by the top 5 customers, based on their total payment amount.  The query uses CTEs to filter and aggregate data from the database.


SELECT AVG (total_amount_payment) AS average FROM
(SELECT B.customer_id, B.first_name, B.last_name, E.country, D.city, SUM(A.amount) AS
	total_amount_payment
	FROM payment A
	INNER JOIN customer B ON B.customer_id = A.customer_id
	INNER JOIN address C ON C.address_id = B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city D ON D.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country E ON E.country_id = D.country_id
	WHERE D.city IN (
	SELECT D.city FROM customer B
	INNER JOIN address C ON C.address_id = B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city D ON D.city_id = C.city_id
	INNER JOIN country E ON E.country_id = D.country_id
	WHERE E.country IN (
	SELECT E.country FROM customer B
	INNER JOIN address C ON C.address_id = B.address_id
	INNER JOIN city D ON E.country_id = D.country_id
	GROUP BY E.country
	ORDER BY COUNT (B.customer_id) DESC
	LIMIT 10)
	GROUP BY E.country,D.city
	ORDER BY COUNT(B.customer_id) DESC
	LIMIT 10)
	GROUP BY B.customer_id,E.country,D,city
	ORDER BY total_amount_payment DESC
	LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_payment;
